# Smart Campus Proposal to make Tech Park Smart

## Electrical Energy Conservation



### Problem Statement
The educational blocks in our institution consume a significant amount of energy, which is often wasted due to inefficient management. Appliances in these blocks operate on a set schedule, leading to them being switched on even when not needed, resulting in high electricity bills.



### Objectives
1. `Monitoring`: Conduct an analysis of the environment to understand electrical energy consumption patterns.

2. `Intelligence-enabled electrical energy automation system`: Develop an IoT-driven building towards an energy-automated environment.

3. `Electric energy consumption prediction`: Implement prediction capabilities in smart buildings to estimate electric energy consumption for the near future.

These objectives aim to generate and supply the required amount of energy needed to meet the demands of the electric loads.



### Technical Aspects

The technical aspects involve implementing an IoT-driven electrical energy automation system that monitors and regulates energy consumption. The proposed system uses sensors to gather real-time data on energy consumption patterns and processes the information through machine learning algorithms to provide predictive insights into energy consumption. The system also includes automation controls to enable efficient energy use in educational blocks.
