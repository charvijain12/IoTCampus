## Smart Campus
Smart campus is a more comprehensive IoT simulation compared to the smart homes, both network and IoT layout, are in fact more complex in order to show a deeper interaction between the IoT devices. Smart-Campus simulated a university campus where, along with traditional school and apartment networks, an IoT network allowed to connect different IoT devices spread across the campus premises. Examples of RFID access control management and intelligent sport field watering solution were included in the simulation. 
 

## Network Layout
The network layout in this exercise is more complex compared to previous lab exercises. This network topology includes 

•	Backbone router network

•	Traditional switch-based classroom wired network

•	Wireless LAN for the apartment buildings

•	Dedicated IoT network based also on switch


## Usage
To use the Smart Campus simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer, follow these steps:

1. Download and install Cisco Packet Tracer on your computer.

2. Open the `Smart-Campus-Design.pkt` file included in the repository in Cisco Packet Tracer.

3. The file will load the Smart Campus network topology and the IoT devices connected to it.

4. You can then simulate different scenarios by configuring the devices and running the simulation.

5. The simulation will output various data and visualizations to help you understand the behavior of the Smart Campus network and its IoT devices.


Note: The `Smart-Campus-Design.pkt` file was created using Cisco Packet Tracer version 7.3.1. Older or newer versions may have compatibility issues.
