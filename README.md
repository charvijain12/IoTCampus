# IoTCampus: Cisco Packet Tracer 

**IoTCampus is a more comprehensive IoT simulation compared to smart homes, with a more complex network and IoT layout. It aims to demonstrate deeper interactions between IoT devices. IoTCampus simulation simulates a university campus, incorporating traditional school and apartment networks and an IoT network to connect various IoT devices across the campus. It includes examples of RFID access control management and an intelligent sport field watering solution.**

## Network Layout 

This exercise features a complex network layout, including:

- Backbone router network
- Traditional switch-based classroom wired network
- Wireless LAN for the apartment buildings
- Dedicated IoT network also based on a switch

## Usage 

To use the Smart Campus simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer, follow these steps:

1. Download and install Cisco Packet Tracer on your computer.

2. Open the `Smart Campus Design.pkt` file provided in this repository using Cisco Packet Tracer.

3. The file will load the Smart Campus network topology and the IoT devices connected to it.

4. You can simulate different scenarios by configuring the devices and running the simulation.

5. The simulation provides various data and visualizations to help you understand the behavior of the Smart Campus network and its IoT devices.

**Note:** The `Smart Campus Design.pkt` file was created using Cisco Packet Tracer version 8.1.0. Compatibility with older or newer versions may vary.
